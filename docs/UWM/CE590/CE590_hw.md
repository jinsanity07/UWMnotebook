- Are Millennials Really the “Go-Nowhere” Generation?
  - Great Recession 
  - peak travel 
  - Two theories
    - emphasizes **attitudes**;
    - focuses on **demographic and economic factors**,
  - Generation X (those born in the late 1960s to the late 1970s)
  - Millennials 
    - born between 1979 and 1990;
  - graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws
  - relative contribution of three factors to changes in automobility: 
    - 1) **demographic** shifts related to **lifestyle changes** across generations; 
    - 2) changes over time that affected **all age groups** 
      (e.g., in- creases in the cost of driving); and 
    - 3) changes over time that affected **only younger generations** 
      (e.g., differential uptake of online interaction and changing attitudes to mobility).
  - What These Findings Mean for Transport Planning and Policy Making
    - younger Americans are increasingly going fewer places.
    - **response** 
      - 1) encouraging sustainable travel as the mobility needs of Millennials increase, and 
        - planners’ role in new travel technologies
      - 2) forecasting long-range travel demand.
        - Improve travel demand models and 
        - adopt a scenario planning approach
  - three paths to **sustainable mobility**: 
    - reducing travel needs through **technology**; 
      - electrical car 
    - encouraging **modal shift** from cars to travel by foot, bike, and transit; 
      - active transportation 
    - and reducing travel distances through **land use strategies**.
      - compact and mixed
- **Conclusion** 
  - analysis(two facotrs) 
  - two implications
    - it is likely to increase as Millennials age
      - Government policies will help shape the form
      - a complementary set of strategies 
        (Existing travel demand management strategies along with newer ride hailing and ridesharing apps)
    - uncertainty about the trajectory of Millennial travel.
      - Long-range transport plans

U.S. Commuting Trends from a National Sample, 1985–2005

- women changes
  - in-home and out-of-home labor explanations
- “quiet revolution: w increased participation in the workforce and their increased orientation to careers in their education and their work plans
- relations
  - Distances and Travel Time
  - Gender and Race
    - The details of these patterns remain understudied
  - Age and Family Type
    - Marriage is associated with shorter commutes for women, 
    - but children are not an influencing fac- tor statistically.
  - Substantial Differences
    - In particular, the commutes of **married women with children are lengthening at a rate t**hree times faster than that for the commutes of their working husbands.
    - The gender gap is smallest for younger women
      cohort ages.
    - the variation in behaviors and circumstances linked to gender requires more detailed exploration.

Considerations for Policy, Planning, and Forecasting



- changes in population: 
  increases in vehicle ownership, the entrance of baby boomers—especially women—into the workforce
- output in travel demand:  
  demand is slowing and occasionally declining.

the growing diversity of the U.S. population and changes in the social norms of travel play important roles in shaping travel demand.



- Household Travel in Context
  - Minority groups vary from white house- holds in terms of these key factors.
- Population Growth and Age Distribution
  - the current minority groups will be the main contributors to population growth
- Vehicle Availability and Licensure Rates
  - Licensure rates reveal age and gender differences.
- Household Size and Travel Rates
- Mode Use



- Prospects for the Future
  - On average, minorities are more dependent on 
    transit, 
    have higher occupancy levels in automobiles, and have lower levels of vehicle ownership.
