## Everything

Q: 
* To search for all Markdown files (typically having the .md extension) recursively in a directory using "Everything," a desktop search utility for Windows that can instantly locate files and folders by name,

A: 

1. **Specify the Directory:** To search within a specific directory, you'll need to use the path of the directory as part of your search query. For your example directory (`J:\My Drive`), you would start your query with the path, ensuring to use double quotes if your path contains spaces.
2. **Use Wildcards for Recursive Search:** To find all Markdown files recursively, use a wildcard pattern that matches `.md` files.
3. **Combine Path and Pattern:** Your search query in Everything should look like this:

```bash
"J:\My Drive" *.md
```
